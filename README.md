# Server-TCP-Chat
A very simple TCP server with a socket waiting for client connections on port 8124. A mini chat application just for testing.

## Steps:

1. **Start the server**

   ```bash
   node chat.js
   ```

2. **Create multiple clients connecting on port 8124**

   ```bash
   telnet localhost 8124
   ```
